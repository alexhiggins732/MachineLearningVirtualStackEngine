OpCode Unit Test:
	Need complete coverage of ILEngine Opcodes
	1) OpCodes have been stored to dev database. Bootstrap so database can be recreated/deployed.
	2) Generate Dictionary<OpCode, Action>() to ensure complete engine coverage.
	3) Make generator to allow Action dictionary to be inlined into a static engine.

	Alternative:
		Code Coverage:
			Can work with static inline engine and assure unit tests cover 100% of the engine.
			Benefits:
				Easier to implement.
			Cons:
				Need to be able to guarantee engine has switch for all opcodes.

	Refactor unit tests:
